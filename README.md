This repo is a snapshot in time. I have no intention to update it.

## Per-application run-or-raise binds.

[Alt-tab is slow.](https://vickychijwani.me/blazing-fast-application-switching-in-linux/) Cardinal window switching, putting apps on dedicated workspaces is slow. 

All often used apps have unique binds that jump to their workspace and focus them. This takes the least keystrokes. If the app is closed, that same bind will run and position it suitably. All frequently used apps are run on startup. Achieved using a slightly modified version of [jumpapp](https://github.com/mkropat/jumpapp).

Image with my run-or-raise binds laid out on my keyboard. You can see how the binds correlate to the windows' position on the screen
